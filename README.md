## 👋 Hi there

I’m **Laveesh Tomar**, a backend-focused engineer with hands-on experience working on **production-scale e-commerce systems**.

I enjoy working close to real systems — debugging failures, improving reliability, and building backend services that behave predictably under load. My interests lean toward **backend engineering, system reliability, and scalable service design**.

I value clarity over cleverness and prefer understanding *why* something fails rather than just making it “work”.

## 🚀 Expertise

- Backend development with a strong focus on **reliability and real-world failure handling**
- Designing and maintaining **REST APIs** used in production environments
- Debugging complex issues across **payments, orders, and third-party integrations**
- Writing clean, modular backend code inside **existing and legacy codebases**
- Improving system performance through **query optimization and API tuning**
- Containerizing backend services and thinking in terms of **deployable units**

I learn best by working on real problems — production bugs, broken flows, and systems under pressure.

## 🧠 Engineering Approach

- Think in **failure modes**, not just happy paths  
- Prefer **simple, readable solutions** over over-engineering  
- Treat backend systems as **long-running services**, not scripts  
- Optimize only after understanding **where time and resources are spent**  
- Learn continuously from incidents, reviews, and system behavior
